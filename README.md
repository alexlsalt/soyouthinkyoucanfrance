# So You Think You Can France

### Created and developed by [Alex Morton](https://alexlsalt.github.io/)  

So You Think You Can France is my latest rebuild of a website I previously built in 2016 when I was teaching English in a French high school as part of the Teaching Assistant Program in France (TAPIF). It's a resource for other American teachers in France and includes information on different cities and villages around France - gathered from past teaching assistants, themselves.

Built using React (front-end), Firebase Firestore (database). Deployed with Netlify.

      <h3>10 Major Differences Between French & American High Schools</h3>
      <p>
        The French high school experience is crazily different from the American
        high school experience. Generally speaking, French high schools mean
        business when it comes to how they expect their students to behave - aka
        long school days, no extracurriculars, no school spirit, etc. Read on to
        see some of my observations!
      </p>
      <h4>10 MAJORS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FRENCH & AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          French students have hyper-long school days.
          <br />
          <br />
          French students are usually at school from 8am to 6pm with short
          morning and afternoon breaks and a lunch hour or two (depending on
          their schedule). What’s more is that it’s just straight academics all
          the way through the day - no clubs, activities, etc.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          (French School) When a teacher is absent, class is cancelled.
          <br />
          <br />
          This means there aren’t any substitute teachers and that if a teacher
          has to miss a day, it’s kind of like American university where you
          just get a notification (hopefully!) that class has been cancelled.
          Unfortunately this could work against you as an assistant by arriving
          to a cancelled class with no previous notification! Cover your bases
          and check in with your teachers the day or night before!
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          (French School) No (or very limited) extracurricular activities.
          <br />
          <br />
          No music class, no art classes, no photography classes, no clubs.
          Students come to school to learn. The closest thing I can compare to
          an extracurricular is that each class has a delegate that represents
          the class for the class updates/meetings among teachers.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          (French School) Sports are not a thing.
          <br />
          <br />
          At least not in the American sense. Some bigger high schools may have
          partnerships with local sports clubs in order to form high school
          teams, but it’s nothing like in the U.S. No football stadiums, soccer
          fields, or basketball/volleyball gyms. For those students who do play
          sports, practices are normally held for an hour or two once a week, on
          Wednesdays.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          (French School) Dances are not a thing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Think: Prom, Winter Formal, Sadie Hawkins, Homecoming, etc. Nothing
          like that for French high school students. They love talking and
          learning about the experiences of American high school students so
          keep this in mind when you’re thinking about what to discuss in class.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          (French School) School spirit - you guessed it: not a thing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Think of High School Musical (or your own high school experience if
          you’re American). Now immediately erase it from your mind, and you’ll
          end up with the French idea of school spirit. Don’t even think of
          t-shirts or sweatshirts with your school name and color.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          French High School is 3 years instead of 4.
          <br />
          <br />
          France has three years of high school and four of middle school.
          (Although I could never imagine four years of such a confusing time as
          junior high!) The first year of high school is called “Seconde,” the
          second is “Première,” and the final year is “Terminale.”
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          French students choose a “major” in high school. At the end of
          their first year of high school, students must decide what they want
          to focus on in terms of school subjects. They are basically funneled
          into whatever career track they “think” they want to pursue when
          they’re 14-15 years old. I didn’t know what I wanted to really study
          until the end of my freshman year of university….
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          French grades are given out of 20 points.
          <br />
          <br />
          Of those 20 points, 16 is considered an excellent score, even for the
          best students in the class. 20 is theoretically unattainable - whereas
          in the US, students have no trouble getting 100s (perfect scores) on
          tests if they really apply themselves. I’ve often thought this has a
          lot to do with the optimistic, "can-do" attitude of Americans versus
          the general pessimism of the French - even if you study your ass of
          and know everything perfectly, the subjective scores of the teachers
          can still leave a little (or a lot) to be desired.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Notes home to parents in French students’ notebooks
          <br />
          <br />
          French students have little carnets de correspondance in which notes
          will be written to parents if they misbehave. They’ve had these
          notebooks since they were small in elementary school. If French
          students get in trouble and their teacher demands to see their
          carnets, you know it's bad.

      <h3>30 Reasons Why I Love Teaching English in France</h3>
      <p>
        While life teaching abroad (or just teaching in general) isn’t always
        the most amazing thing ever, I decided to come up with a list of 30
        reasons why I’m so grateful for exactly where I am right now in life -
        in my little French high school just outside of Toulouse. I hope other
        teaching assistants can connect with this and that future assistants
        will use it as inspiration for their upcoming time as teaching
        assistants in France!

          felt learning it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I get to show French students that there are other ways of life,

          desires, and habits.

        <li>
          I get to demonstrate the fact that the face of America is NOT as it is

          leadership.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>

        <li>
          Sometimes I show up to a new class, nervous to meet the students and

          last year.
        </li>
        <li>
          I get to have a new appreciation all the time about my own time in
          high school and being exposed to different things through sports,
          extracurriculars, and by being encouraged to think my own thoughts and
          innovative ideas.
        </li>
        <li>

          meeting new people and friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          I get to work in an environment that is so dynamic and literally NEVER
          the same from day to day.
        </li>
        <li>I get to practice and solidify my French.</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          I get to watch students improve their English while they gain enormous

          own experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          I get to have a daily dose of reality checks and patience practice in
          the classroom - making me an overall more humble person.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’ve gotten better at advocating for myself and speaking up in
          less-than-favorable circumstances.

      <h3>Assistant Spotlight with Reuben Ramsay</h3>
      <p>
        HI REUBEN! WHERE DO YOU COME FROM AND WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO TEACH
        ENGLISH IN FRANCE?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello. I'm from Montreal, Canada. I grew up in and around Toronto
        though. Well [the opportunity] sort of came to me. In 2013, I decided I
        was tired of the 'status quo' or whatevah and decided to take up French
        again. I took French until grade 12, but you really can't be bilingual
        until you immerse yourself in a francophone environment, so I moved to
        Montreal in 2014. I came to a point in my life where I was feeling a
        sort of complacency. At the time I was in dance class and my dance
        partner Julia told me she lived in France. I asked her how, she showed
        me the program and I had to think if I really wanted this because for
        the application process alone, it cost me almost $200 to get a passport.
        All in all, an opportunity presented itself to me, I took it, and now
        I'm in the south of France eating all bougie. I also discovered my
        passion for teaching.
      </p>
      <p>WHAT LEVEL DO YOU TEACH AND HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?</p>
      <p>
        I teach lycée and collège level. I do like it. I wouldn't enjoy teaching
        little children personally. I prefer working with a more mature brain
        y'know. Lycéens are way more interesting, but can be challenging to
        engage, which pushes me to be more thought-provoking.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHAT ARE THREE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR FUTURE LANGUAGE ASSISTANTS WHO WANT TO
        TEACH IN FRANCE?
      </p>
      <p>
        These are my personal opinions:
        <br /><br />
        1. You might want to consider getting
        out of the TAPIF mindset. For me, I really limit the amount of friends I
        have in the program. I keep maybe 1-2 assistant acquaintances
        semi-close. You never know what could happen. Other than that, I don't
        see myself as a 'TAPIF-er' or whatever. I am a Canadian working abroad.
        TAPIF is only a means to get here. This is not a vacation or a field
        trip, I take this job seriously as I would any other. I've seen people
        complain how they weren't prepared/warned by TAPIF about certain aspects
        on living here (excess free time, isolation, etc.) but in reality, if
        you choose to move states or countries outside of a program, you can't
        expect someone to hold your hand either. With that being said, come to
        France with an open mind that wants to discover the soul of the nation.
        Get involved in activities with the community! I came here to integrate,
        and I think that was the best decision I made. With this being said, get
        used to getting shit done yourself. French administration is infamously
        counterintuitive and slow. If you don't understand what document you
        need, ask them to clarify. Don't be afraid to make them repeat
        themselves or to explain and give examples. Criteria can vary from bank
        to bank, region to region, landlord to landlord, etc. So even if the
        person you're dealing with lacks a bit of patience, be firm until you
        are confident that you understand everything. 
        <br /><br />
        2. Know what it is you
        want and shape your experience around this. I recognize that tip #1 is
        not for everyone. Maybe you do want to have a TAPIF experience and have
        friends from different countries. Perhaps you are doing this to travel.
        What's important is that you know why you're doing this beforehand to
        help you be happier when you're there. If you want to travel, budget
        your travel money the year before! If you want a little TAPIF community,
        start chatting with the locals on the FB group etc. If you want to
        integrate and have a very French experience, go places alone and chat it
        up with random strangers, download Tinder etc. 3. Be grateful and be
        grounded. When you're there, make sure you take in every moment and be
        grateful for the opportunity to be there. Explore and don't be afraid to
        try things you would have never tried back home. You can reinvent
        yourself. You're going to get lonely, it's normal so take the time to
        develop a self-care routine and talk to your loved ones back home for
        some much-needed venting!
      </p>
      <p>
        AS A LANGUAGE ASSISTANT, WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU FIND USEFUL (FOR PLANNING
        LESSONS, FOR USING IN CLASS, ETC.)?
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet has a lot of great resources, but I just go with the flow.
        I like to talk about controversial topics with my lycéens. We've talked
        about the n-word, the legalization of marijuana, sexism etc. I take the
        time to talk about issues that might change a student's outlook on life.
        I bought the app Heads Up! by Ellen Degeneres as a great warm up.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE LESSON OR ACTIVITY YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO
        WITH ONE OF YOUR CLASSES?
      </p>
      <p>I led a dance class!</p>
      <p>
        WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY DOING OR WORKING ON IN YOUR FREE TIME IN FRANCE?
      </p>
      <p>
        I work out, I go to this awesome board game café often. I travel when I
        can. I have apéros with my friends etc. I spend a lot of downtime
        reading or watching things in French! I try to stay in the French world
        as much as sanely possible.
      </p>
      <p>HAVE YOU DONE MUCH TRAVELING SINCE BEING HERE? ANY FAVORITE PLACES?</p>
      <p>
        I've been to San Sebastian in Spain, Bordeaux and Paris. I love them
        all. San Sebastian was full of character and I plan to see more.
      </p>
      <p>DO YOU HAVE ANY BUDGETING ADVICE FOR ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>
        Save as much as you can before coming. Find cheap rent (if possible).
        The rest is up to you and your hustle. Live within your means.
      </p>
      <p>
        THAT'S ABOUT IT! ANY LAST THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD OR ANY PARTING
        WORDS TO CURRENT AND FUTURE TEACHING ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't be afraid to talk to strangers in bars, the gym or at a café,
        you'll be surprised!

      <p>I've noticed Charity around the TAPIF Assistant Facebook group and she's always so positive and helpful, so I knew she'd have some gems to share on Assistant Spotlight! Charity is a Jamaican-American assistant and is currently teaching in Fontainebleau.</p>
      <p>Let's dive in!</p>
      <p>HI CHARITY! SO, WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO TEACH ENGLISH IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>I really enjoyed learning French from native speakers back in high school (Le Lycée Français de Los Angeles), and I thought it would be cool to give a similar experience to students in France. Not to mention, it’s also pretty awesome to be able to live/work in a country that I’ve grown to adore since I was 14.
</p>
      <p>WHAT LEVEL DO YOU TEACH AND HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?</p>
      <p>I currently teach in écoles maternelles (pré-school/kindergarten). It’s a very interesting and entertaining level. The children are always excited (about everything...literally EVERYTHING) which in turn makes me excited to teach them. It can be difficult sometimes, I won’t lie. I don’t have much experience teaching such a young age, and it’s quite different from my experience in lycée and collège. The kids are young and have 0 experience with English, but that just means I have to be a bit more creative with classes, and they seem to enjoy it so far.</p>
      <p>WHAT ARE THREE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR FUTURE LANGUAGE ASSISTANTS WHO WANT TO TEACH IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>1. We tend to romanticize France/French culture (and with good reason often, it’s a lovely place), but it’s important to remember that you’re coming here for a job that you must take seriously. The students really appreciate and need our presence, even if it may not always seem like it. I say that from experience with lycée and collège.<br /><br />2. Go with the flow. You may have to be a bit flexible at times, as things here won’t always be what you’re used to. In order to prevent constant frustration, you just have to go with the flow.<br /><br />3. Try to travel if possible. We have great vacation time, and if it’s within your means, explore the country and surrounding countries. You won’t regret it.</p>
      <p>AS A LANGUAGE ASSISTANT, WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU FIND USEFUL (FOR PLANNING LESSONS, FOR USING IN CLASS, ETC.)?</p>
      <p>Other assistants will prove to be a HUGE help. Also, the wonderful World Wide Web. Seriously, Google has been my BFF.</p>
      <p>WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE LESSON OR ACTIVITY YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH ONE OF YOUR CLASSES?</p>
      <p>My Christmas lesson. Since my kids are so easily excited, I introduced Christmas with a mystery bag full of different Christmas items. They got to feel the bag and make guesses (in French) as to what they thought was in there. And bit by bit, I revealed what was in the bag and they freaked. It was so cute because these are all things that exist in France and most of them had at home, but the added *mystery* of it being hidden and slowly revealed was so fun for them and for me.</p>
      <p>WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY DOING OR WORKING ON IN YOUR FREE TIME IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>I’m trying to improve my French (I should and could be doing a better job at that, i admit ;) ) as well as making plans for grad school. I’d like to get my Masters here in Paris.</p>
      <p>HAVE YOU DONE MUCH TRAVELING SINCE BEING HERE? ANY FAVORITE PLACES?</p>
      <p>I’ve travelled quite a bit around la France herself (the north, the south, the west, not too much of the east yet, though). I’ve also visited Spain, England, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I absolutely adore Spain and England. Before I head home for summer I’d like to knock Morocco and Greece off of my bucket list as well. </p>
      <p>DO YOU HAVE ANY BUDGETING ADVICE FOR ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>Oh God. Lol. I’m probably not the best person to ask, I’ll be frank. One minute I can be the most frugal person, and the next, I'm spending as if we don’t make only €795. I’ve made it work though. I was better at budgeting when I lived in the countryside, but now that I’m back in Paris, I am THE WORST. Definitely try tutoring and babysitting for extra income. If your school offers housing, take it. </p>
      <p>THAT'S ABOUT IT! ANY LAST THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD OR ANY PARTING WORDS TO CURRENT AND FUTURE TEACHING ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>This is going to sound cheesy, but it’s true. This can be such an amazing experience if you allow it to be. It’s hard being away from family, and at first it can seem a bit lonely, but put yourself out there, travel, use it as a way to really get to know yourself better and I promise you you’ll enjoy it. TAPIF’s main purpose is, yes, to teach English, but also use to be used as a time to enhance your cultural palette and grow as an individual. End cheesy rant.</p>

      <h3>Assistant Spotlight with Amber Sweat</h3>
      <p>I knew I wanted to eventually feature Amber on the So You Think You Can France blog when I'd watch her Instagram stories (really!!). </p>
      <p>Although we've never met, I just had a hunch that she was a rad chick because of her mentions of cool lessons she was planning, how she was making her life in Aubervilliers (just outside of Paris) her very own, and her boldness at being silly and real for people watching!</p>
      <p>I'm so excited to share this version of Assistant Spotlight with you all and I hope you enjoy Amber's interview as much as I enjoyed receiving her answers!</p>
      <p>HI AMBER! FIRST THINGS FIRST - WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?</p>
      <p>Howdy! I hail from the great state of Texas! I was raised in the Dallas area, but lived in Austin for college.</p>
      <p>WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO TEACH ENGLISH IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>French was my major and has always been a huge part of my life! My ultimate goal is to become a French Professor in the United States. After some mentorship, tutoring and teaching gigs at UT Austin, I decided to flip the switch and try teaching English in France for a while. For a few months, I lived in Paris as a research fellow at the Sorbonne, but fell in love with the hustle and bustle of the northeastern banlieues. With this in mind, I applied to the Académie de Créteil, was accepted, and I have never looked back!</p>
      <p>WHAT LEVEL DO YOU TEACH AND HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?</p>
      <p>I teach at a lycée and I absolutely love it. I work with students in 2, 1, and terminale (equivalent to sophomores, juniors and seniors in the USA). My kids vary in their English levels -- from very rudimentary to near-fluent -- but they are all incredibly curious and enjoy asking me about life in America! Even with the lower levels, I've been so lucky to have some great talks from subjects like rap and race relations, to fast food, to pets, to Pictionary and everything in between.</p>
      <p>WHAT ARE THREE TIPS YOU HAVE FOR FUTURE LANGUAGE ASSISTANTS WHO WANT TO TEACH IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>1. When you get assigned to a school, you will be given a contact teacher known as a "tuteur/tutrice." They are going to be an indispensable force. I've been very lucky to have an awesome mentor teacher (and really amazing colleagues in general), and if you find that y'all are able to maintain good conversation and a positive rapport, keep it up! They will help you with everything, from finding temporary lodging, to ameliorating situations with difficult classes, to recommendations for lunch and so on. Some people do not have this connection, and if that's the case, look for a surrogate in the form of a secretary, another teacher, a landlord, or a speaking group, and so on! This also greatly helps mollify loneliness when the holiday season comes.</p>
      <p>2. On loneliness, you may very well get lonely/homesick and that is completely, completely okay. I think when people move to France, we don't have "the right" to complain, because getting a funded work opportunity in Europe is a privilege. However, you are allowed to be homesick and ask for help. A lot of the time, this happens because we assistants have too much time on our hands (12 hrs/week is not a lot!) and we spend a lot of time alone or in our own minds. Try to get involved in those other hours, as much as possible. In a large city, this is pretty easy- in smaller cities, think about keeping pen pals, writing letters, volunteering more of your time at the school, etc. Boredom is dangerous, and if you feel it creeping, start looking for involvement or travel opportunities. Also, reach out to other assistants; even a sporadic Facebook message can remind you of the awesome community you're a part of!
</p>
      <p>3. Always remember that your job is not to teach English in a formal sense, but instead show your students that English rocks, and they have all of the potential to learn it and speak it! Students tend to love assistants and have tons of questions, but they may be nervous and stay silent. Make sure you break that wall as soon as possible by being a "no judgement, no grading" type of zone. Reassure them and remind them that they're doing a great job. What's also important to note is that, because we're native anglophones, we can understand them completely fine, even if they make mistakes -- this is something that sets us apart from other teachers, and makes them more comfortable with us. Flaunt that you're American/Canadian/British/Irish/Jamaican/Australian/etc.! I think that, for the most part, we work really hard to integrate into French society through bureaucracy, the way we dress, etc. Celebrate the fact that the school is the place where you're allowed to be unabashedly and proudly Anglophone :)</p>
      <p>AS A LANGUAGE ASSISTANT, WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU FIND USEFUL (FOR PLANNING LESSONS, FOR USING IN CLASS, ETC.)?</p>
      <p>Honestly, the various assistant Facebook groups have been awesome. Assistants list tons of ideas that I've been able to bounce off of or recalibrate for certain levels, and people are so generous and willing to share what does and doesn't work for them. Make connections with other assistants in real life, as well! Being able to brainstorm with people in your position makes life much easier.</p>
      <p>WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE LESSON OR ACTIVITY YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH ONE OF YOUR CLASSES?</p>
      <p>I wanted to teach in a ZEP (zone d'éducation prioritaire) and have since been placed in one. As mentioned, I love it, my kids are amazing, but traditional topics aren't the most fun or engaging for them. I was really concerned with making sure the kids talked about what they *want* to talk about and, on the first day of class, "rap" and "music" were very common responses to "what interests you about anglophone culture?" This made me incredibly excited, because I LOVE rap as well, and grew up on hip hop. From that, I made a lesson on rap, and it has been my most successful to this day. I had the kids watch a music video (I heavily recommend "i" by Kendrick Lamar, the studio version) and had them brainstorm certain subjects that rap talks about (racism, money, luxe, gangs, etc.) From there, I had them create a rap persona, tell me what they would rap about, and why. The responses were hilarious, but also incredibly sentimental and profound.</p>
      <p>WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY DOING OR WORKING ON IN YOUR FREE TIME IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>I'm in the process of finishing up my applications to PhD programs in the States, so that's taken up most of my time this semester (cross your fingers for me, please!) I started learning and practicing German, and am also refining my Spanish, so I imagine that those languages will take up a nice amount of my time in the spring. I also do some freelance translation, and plan to start tutoring when I find an opportunity!</p>
      <p>HAVE YOU DONE MUCH TRAVELING SINCE BEING HERE? ANY FAVORITE PLACES?</p>
      <p>I haven't done a lot of traveling just yet, because I've spent the first few months relaxing and settling into the flow of life. That said, I just got back from my first trip, which was a weekend stint in Amsterdam -- heavily recommend, (especially around Christmas; it's GORGEOUS and you can find some AMAZING bus deals!) In the spring, I'm going to Spain, Portugal, Germany, various (undecided) countries in eastern Europe, and hopefully some Nordic countries.</p>
      <p>DO YOU HAVE ANY BUDGETING ADVICE FOR ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?</p>
      <p>On rent: I'm placed in a school that is a 5-minute walk to Paris, and, like many people in the Paris region, I really wanted to live in Paris (which makes total sense, since it's beautiful!) This tends to be the case for most big cities. However, I chose to live in my banlieue, and I've had a very positive experience. Rent tends to plummet once you leave the city limits, and that has given me more money for travel and experiences. Of course, this is completely up to your comfort level and what you want/availability, but it is possible to be immersed in big city life, even if you're not living in the proper center (bonus points if you're lucky enough to live on the metro line!) </p> 
      <p>On travel: Look as far in advance as you can. Buses are cheap and actually relatively comfortable if you want to visit bordering countries like Brussels, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, etc. I even took a bus to the Netherlands, and it was great! When going to a farther country, planes are typically cheaper. Travel with only a carry-on to save money on checked baggage, and stay in hostels (they're tons of fun, and meeting other travelers is awesome!) </p> 
      <p>On everyday life: Try as much as you can not to eat out; this is always my cardinal sin. Cook, cook, cook, and don't shy away from getting a carte de fidélité at your local supermarket or squatting to the bottom shelf of the wine aisle :) If you have to buy food, local boulangeries and small businesses tend to offer better deals on quick meals like lunch, as opposed to fast food places or big-box markets. I know self check-out/those machines at McDonalds are tempting because you don't have to speak French and can get in and out quickly, but nothing beats a warm boulangerie quiche after classes on Wednesday!</p> 
      <p>THAT'S ABOUT IT! ANY LAST THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD OR ANY PARTING WORDS TO CURRENT AND FUTURE TEACHING ASSISTANTS IN FRANCE?</p> 
      <p>Feeling grateful and being frustrated are not mutually exclusive. You may be so happy to get into TAPIF, but a little sad that you didn't get into your top choice region. In one day, you can take an absolutely beautiful and breathtaking walk, then get rejected by the third bank you've visited just one hour later. One day, all of your classes will give you amazing answers to prompts on gun control, then the next, they may not be able to say their own age. That's okay, and it's normal, because it's life! The bad doesn't always have to cancel out the good. The TAPIF experience, as with most experiences abroad, is very idiosyncratic and all about balance -- balance within yourself, balance within your school and balance within society. Try as best as you can to balance yourself and find ways to maintain this equilibrium. Also, always feel free to ask for help from your mentors or friends, and keep communication fluid.</p> 
      <p>France is such a grandiose and amazing country, and social media has become so powerful, that we feel inclined to do big, amazing things on the daily (like scale the Eiffel Tower, pop champagne or fall in tumultuous love with a stranger.) Not only is this not realistic, but when you become a worker in a society, you'll start to get used to the quotidian, dumb, day-to-day frustrations that become that much more evident. To combat this, always celebrate little victories, like the sun being extra warm, the 45 cent coffee in the workroom, a student smiling at you in the hallway, a really good croissant, your bank card coming in, or a kid perfecting the past tense of "to go" -- there are so many little things to celebrate during assistantship, and remembering them will make the experience that much better (the Eiffel tower is pretty cool, too!) </p> 
      <p>TAPIF is an amazing experience and I am so, so happy that I have the opportunity to work with such a great program. The connections and friendships I have made are lifelong, and I encourage everybody who is considering it to go for it -- you won't regret it!</p>
